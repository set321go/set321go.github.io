title: Another AWS lambda example
layout: post

First go building a server less backend using aws. I have a small contrived example based around a train manager game. My stack so far consists of:
* [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)
* [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
* [dynamodb](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)

First impressions - Its not ready for prime time.
